The goal of this program is to create a simpler version of Blackjack. This game will disregard a number of the special rules that are in BJ (such as Ace can be considered either number 1 or number 11). The cards are between the ranges of 1 to 10. All of the cards have an equal chance of being drawn (unlike the real BJ game where there's more likelihood for a 10 to be drawn).

Once the program starts running, two random cards are drawn and the total for these two cards will be displayed. The program will ask if the user would like to draw more cards. Unlike traditional Blackjack, the first pair of cards that are drawn will never be considered 'blackjack' or have a sum of 21 (as the max in our range of cards in 10 hence the highest the first set of cards can reach is only 20).

The user need to input either 'y' or 'n' in response to either they want to draw more cards or not. If the user input 'y', the new card will be displayed and the sum of the total will change (to the 'old sum' plus the new card number). The program will continue asking the user if they would like to draw more cards until the sum of the card equals (win) or is over 21 (bust).

The game will then ask the user if they would like to play again and this game will continue (if the user input 'y') until the user decide to stop play (input 'n').
